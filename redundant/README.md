# Redundant Code

This folder contains obsolete code that has been moved here temporarily before permanent deletion. The code in this folder is no longer used in the main application.

## Contents

- **home/**: The old home screen implementation which has been replaced by the feature-based architecture in `lib/features/home/`

## Why This Exists

This folder exists as a temporary storage for code that has been replaced but might still be useful for reference. Once the new implementation is fully stable, the contents of this folder can be safely deleted.

## Migration Status

- ✅ Home screen migrated to feature-based architecture
- ✅ Settings page moved to the lib root
- ✅ All references to old implementation removed

## Next Steps

1. Verify the new implementation works correctly in all scenarios
2. Delete this folder once confirmation is complete
